 * All function pointers must be non-NULL. Each receives the `ctx` pointer from
 * the struct as its first argument.
 *
 * Two requirements beyond the C library equivalents: `calloc_fn` must treat
 * overflow of `nitems * size` as an allocation failure and return NULL rather
 * than allocating a truncated block, and a zero-size request should return a
 * usable non-NULL pointer, so that NULL always means failure.

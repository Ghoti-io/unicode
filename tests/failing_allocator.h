/**
 * An allocator that refuses one nominated request and serves every other.
 *
 * The counterpart of FailingSink, for the other half of the library. The
 * loaders are dense with allocation-failure arms - every array append, every
 * string copy - and none of them can run against an allocator that always
 * succeeds. Nor can they run against one that always fails: that reaches the
 * first arm and no other.
 *
 * So the refusal is a dial. Constructed with `n`, this serves every request
 * but the nth; sweeping n from zero upwards walks a single refusal through
 * the whole of a parse, one site at a time.
 *
 * **How many requests to refuse is a parameter, and all three settings are
 * needed.** Each was arrived at by planting a defect the previous setting
 * could not see:
 *
 * - `run = 0`, every request from the nth onwards. What genuine exhaustion
 *   looks like, and the only setting that reaches the loaders'
 *   `gcu_array_append() failed` arms at all - because cutil's reserve_n()
 *   answers a refused 1.5x growth by retrying at the exact size needed, on
 *   purpose, so refusing one request never fails an append.
 * - `run = 1`, the nth request alone. The only setting that can show a
 *   refusal being survived *and losing something*: under sustained refusal an
 *   arm that gives up quietly carries on, asks for the next allocation, is
 *   refused again, and the parse ends up failing for the right reason by
 *   accident.
 * - `run = 2`, the nth and the one after. What it takes to fail a single
 *   *append* rather than a single request, since the retry makes one logical
 *   append cost two. `run = 1` cannot fail an append at all and `run = 0`
 *   cannot survive one; a quiet give-up in an append arm is invisible to
 *   both. A planted one was.
 *
 * `run = 2` does not subsume `run = 1`: where two unrelated single-request
 * sites sit next to each other it refuses both, and a defect at the first can
 * be hidden by the parse dying correctly at the second.
 *
 * It also counts live blocks, because an abandoned parse has two ways to be
 * wrong and the interesting one is silent: reporting the failure and keeping
 * what it had already built. `live()` is the check for that, and it means the
 * sweep does not depend on running under a sanitizer to be worth anything.
 *
 * Refusal is spelled exactly as the allocator contract spells it - NULL, with
 * the caller's block untouched on a realloc, since a realloc() that fails
 * must leave the original allocation alone.

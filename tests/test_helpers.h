 * assumed - and which chooses the name and creates the file in one step that
 * fails if the name is taken. The helper this replaced invented a name,
 * deleted it, and reopened it with an extension appended, leaving a window in
 * which something else could take the path. The extension itself is gone with
 * it: nothing in this library decides anything from a file's name.

 * The handle stays open for the object's lifetime. A test that reopens
 * path() to write to it is reopening the same file, which is what the dump
 * round-trip tests do.

/**
 * A `FILE *` that accepts a set number of writes and fails every one after.
 *
 * The dumpers are almost all error handling by line count - every `fprintf`
 * is checked - and until this existed not one of those arms had ever run.
 * A test can only see them by handing over a stream that fails, and it has
 * to fail on demand rather than always, because failing on the first write
 * exercises exactly one of them.
 *
 * Buffering is off, so one `fprintf` is one write: constructed with `n`, the
 * sink serves n writes and fails the one after. Sweeping n from zero upwards
 * walks the failure through the whole of a dump.
 *
 * `fopencookie` is glibc's, and Windows has nothing like it: a CRT `FILE *`
 * cannot be given callbacks. There the failure is served one step higher, at
 * the library's own call. The test links with `-Wl,--wrap=__mingw_fprintf`
 * (the name MinGW's headers give `fprintf` in C), so every `fprintf` the
 * dumpers make lands in the wrapper at the end of this header, which counts
 * the ones aimed at the sink and returns -1 once the budget is spent. The
 * dumpers see exactly what they see on Linux - `fprintf` answering negative
 * with errno set - so the same arms run. What is not exercised on Windows is
 * the CRT turning a failed write into that answer, which is the CRT's code.
 * If the library ever writes through anything but `fprintf`, the wrapper
 * stops seeing it, the sweeps find no failures to count, and their floors
 * fail - so this cannot go quietly vacuous.
